Setup
=====

Quick start
-----------

Grab the latest stable release, unpack it and run 'python setup.py
install' from the directory where you placed it. Isn't that easy?


Requirements
============
 * Pcapy >= 0.10.5
 * Impacket >= 0.9.6

Installing
----------

In order to install the source execute the following command from the
directory where the UrlSniffer's distribution has been unpacked: 'python
setup.py install'. This will install the classes into the default
Python's modules path; note that you might need special permissions to
write there. For more information on what commands and options are
available from setup.py, run 'python setup.py --help-commands'.
